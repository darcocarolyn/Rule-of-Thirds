# Rule-of-Thirds

This is a static webpage for a film premiere event called Rule of Thirds. It was created mainly through HTML and CSS. There is a bit of JavaScript in order to implement a contact inquiry form using email JS for any users who might have any questions about the event.

Unfortunately, there was a falling out betwwen the event planners and the film director, so the website was never launched.
